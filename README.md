# bubble-sort

There are many algorithms that deal with sorting collections of data. One of the most basic forms of sorting is known as Bubble Sort and is named by it's nature of the order of data having a "bubbling" effect as a collection of data is sorted. We will start off by implementing a Bubble Sort algorithm on a one-dimensional Array.

##Bubble Sort Implementation

The trick to remembering bubble sort is to visualize that your array is vertical rather than horizontal. If smaller values are "deeper" in the array, they will "rise" to the top until they are the smallest value. If larger values are "higher" in the array, they will sink to the bottom until they are the largest value.

## In this Project

In this project I have created a function that works as a basic bubble sort algorithm, together with some code that test against my function.
